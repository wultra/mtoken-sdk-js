## Introduction
 
With Wultra Mobile Token (WMT) SDK, you can integrate an out-of-band operation approval into an existing mobile app, instead of using a standalone mobile token application. WMT is built on top of [PowerAuth Mobile JS SDK](https://github.com/wultra/react-native-powerauth-mobile-sdk). Individual endpoints are described in the [Mobile Token API](https://developers.wultra.com/components/enrollment-server/develop/documentation/Mobile-Token-API).

To understand the Wultra Mobile Token SDK purpose on a business level better, you can visit our own [Mobile Token application](https://www.wultra.com/mobile-token). We use (native) Wultra Mobile Token SDK in our mobile token application as well.

**With this SDK, you can:**

- [Retrieve, approve, or reject operations pending approval for a given user.](docs/Using-Operations.md)
- [Claim anonymous operations.](docs/Using-Operations.md#claim-the-operation)
- [Retrieve operation history.](docs/Using-Operations.md#operation-history)
- [Do offline authorization.](docs/Using-Operations.md#off-line-authorization)
- [Register an existing PowerAuth activation to receive push notifications.](docs/Using-Push.md)
- [Manage users' inbox messages.](docs/Using-Inbox.md)
- [Handle OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flows.](docs/Using-OIDC.md)
- [Explore more.](docs)
